This is a practical task designed to gather information about you as a software developer and the way in which you develop.
Things we are looking for: 
* Good code
* Use of version control
* Problem solving ability
* Automated Testing
* Implementing your own ideas

### The Problem
The goal is to write an application in a language and framework of your choice to display the weather forecast. We would like at least a daily forecast and a weekly forecast, any others are a bonus.

There are several weather APIs available, feel free to use any that you see fit. A user should be able to type in a location or postcode and retrieve the forecast for that location.

You can use any styling that you choose along with any client-side libraries and templates. The only requirement for the front end is that it is viewable in a web browser.

Feel free to add your own flourish to the application that is outside of the spec. Some ideas include: 
* A user login
* Autocomplete on locations

### The Technologies
- Ruby
- Rails
- RSpec
- Capybara
- Git(Hub)

### The Instructions
To run the application run `bin/rails s` and visit
`localhost:3000` in the browser. Or alternatively,
visit http://weather-forecaster.herokuapp.com
